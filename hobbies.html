      <h2>Puzzles</h2>
      <p>I like to solve numerous puzzles.
         I can solve the Rubik's Cube in less than a minute.
         I also really enjoy solving jigsaw puzzles!</p>

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>While some may say I am not gifted with a singing voice, I do like to dabble in music by learning instruments.
      I have a guitar and ukelele and like to learn new songs to relax and unwind.
      I stilll have trouble singing and playing, but it is okay because nobody really likes to hear me sing anyway.
